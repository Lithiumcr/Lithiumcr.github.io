1.

2.
Q：你认为你和名牌大学的大学生之间的差距在哪里？
A：高考成绩。
In the college entrance examination scores. Only when compared with THU and PKU.

3.
Q：能力上呢？
A：这…不是我判断的问题，是贵公司判断的问题，我就不回答了。
The assessment of abilities is not within my purview to judge. It is a matter for your esteemed company to evaluate, and I choose not to respond.

4.
Q：你期望的工资是多少？
A：这…不是我期待的事，我也不报价，贵公司认为我值多少，我就按您的报价来。
This is not a matter of my expectations; I refrain from providing a specific figure. Your company determines my value, and I will abide by your offered salary.

5.
Q：除了工资，你还期待公司能有什么福利？
A：没有
None.

6.
Q：你对加班有什么看法？
A：加班本身不是问题，但我确实需要考虑，加班需要我付出的和我能换来的之间，是否基本平衡，这个需要我上了班后才能判断。
Overtime itself is not an issue. However, I do need to consider whether the balance between the effort required for overtime and the returns is fundamentally equitable. This assessment can only be made once I have commenced employment.

7.
Q：工资和工作，哪个对你更重要？
A：工作更重要。但如果工作内容与工资之间差距过大，那这份工作对我的重要性将出现变化。
The job holds more significance for me. However, if there is a substantial disparity between the job responsibilities and the salary, the importance of the job to me will undergo reconsideration.

8.

A：这…不是我能选择的问题，我就不回答了。
The selection of a superior is not within my purview to decide; therefore, I choose not to respond.

9.
Q：你认为我们公司为什么要选你而不选其他应聘者？
A：我不了解其他应聘者的情况，但贵公司选我或不选我，一定有您的判断标准，我不好猜测：
I am not acquainted with the details of other applicants. The decision to choose or not choose me rests on your company's judgment criteria, which I do not presume to speculate upon.

10.
Q：试试猜一下？
A：我还是不猜了。
Still, I prefer not to speculate on this matter.

11.
Q：为什么从上一家公司离职？
A：因为我觉得，贵公司比上一家公司更适合我。
Because I believe your company is a better fit for me than my previous employer.

12.
Q：上一家公司哪里不适合你？
A：这涉及到另一家公司的内部情况，在这里说，可能不大合适。
This involves the internal affairs of another company, and it may not be appropriate to discuss it here.

13.
Q：那如果又有其他公司比我们公司更适合你，你会离职吗？
A：如果真有这种情况，到时候希望能和公司再继续沟通。
If there is a situation like this, I would hope to engage in further discussions with the company at that time.

14.
Q：你为什么还没有找到合适的职位？
A：合适的人，合适的房子，合适的东西，都需要一个寻找、体验、比较的过程，我现在正处在这种过程中。
Finding the right job, like finding the right person or the right house, requires a process of searching, experiencing, and comparing. I am currently in this process.

15.
Q：这个过程什么时候结束？
A：目前还不好说，但如果有幸得到贵公司的offer，这个过程应该就结束了。
It's challenging to specify when this process will conclude, but if I am fortunate enough to receive an offer from your company, this process should come to an end.

16.
Q：说一下自己最大的优点和缺点。
A：优点…服从安排，服从指挥，见贤思齐，沟通效率高，执行意志强，执行能力强，而且接受拿10块钱的工资干二十块钱的活这个逻辑；缺点的话…不太善于社交，对不够伶俐的人缺乏耐心。比如对团队成员，能合作就合作，合作不顺利的话，我会选择自己来。
Strengths... I am obedient to instructions, follow commands, draw inspiration from the wise, have high communication efficiency, strong execution will, and the ability to execute tasks diligently even if the compensation is not commensurate with the effort. As for weaknesses... I am not particularly adept at socializing, and I lack patience with individuals who are not sufficiently adept. For example, with team members, if cooperation is smooth, I collaborate, but if it is not, I choose to handle the task on my own， which is reflexible.、

拓展.
工作中，我不是特别会读气氛。即，不太能接受团队中有人故意怠惰、推卸责任，以及在团队合作中，只会依靠团队而不想着如何通过提升自己的工作能力来提高团队整体的产出，这会导致我在整体工作效率和和谐气氛冲突时会牺牲后者以提高效率，可能显得不够和善，这是我的一个缺点。
生活上，我通常没有任何让朋友觉得不舒服的地方，但不是很善于求助。即，我很不愿意麻烦别人，不到万不得已不会求人帮忙，当然一旦求了我一定会用态度加物质，非常诚恳地感谢对方。同时，我也不太喜欢别人轻易麻烦我，不知道这算不算是个缺点。还好，可能是物以类聚，我交的朋友里也没有经常麻烦别人的。
思想上，人的行动需要以世界观、人生观、价值观为基础的思想体系来指导，不然会经常犯错，但我现在还不能轻易确定我思想上哪处是缺点、哪处是优点，我还需要结合实践不断思考。
In a professional setting, I may not be particularly adept at reading the atmosphere. Specifically, I find it challenging to tolerate individuals within a team who deliberately slack off, evade responsibilities, and solely rely on the team without endeavoring to enhance their own skills to contribute to the overall productivity. This tendency may lead me to prioritize efficiency over maintaining a harmonious atmosphere when faced with conflicts between overall work efficiency and team cohesion, which might make me appear less amiable. This is a recognized weakness on my part.

In my personal life, I generally don't exhibit behaviors that make others uncomfortable, but I am not very inclined to seek assistance. In other words, I am hesitant to trouble others and will only seek help when absolutely necessary. However, when I do seek help, I express sincere gratitude with both attitude and tangible gestures. Simultaneously, I am not fond of others easily imposing on me, and I'm unsure whether this can be considered a weakness. Fortunately, perhaps due to shared values, my circle of friends consists of individuals who do not frequently burden others.

In terms of ideology, I believe that one's actions should be guided by a philosophical framework rooted in a worldview, life philosophy, and set of values. Without such a foundation, frequent mistakes may occur. However, I am currently unable to definitively identify the strengths and weaknesses in my ideological standpoint. It requires continuous reflection, coupled with practical experiences, for me to gain clarity on this matter.

17.
Q：可是你刚说你沟通效率高。
A：是的，对于一定需要沟通的人和事，我善于沟通。不是一定需要，我会用沟通以外的方式处理。
Yes, I do excel at communication when it is necessary. If it is not deemed necessary, I employ methods other than communication to address the matter.

18.
Q：你为什么选择目前你的专业？
A：高中时候对这个专业感兴趣，提前了解过一些基本知识，当时上手较快，就选择了这个专业。
During high school, I developed an interest in this field, acquired some basic knowledge in advance, found that I grasped the concepts quickly, and subsequently chose this major.

19.
Q：为什么应聘目前这个岗位？
A：应聘这个岗位，是因为对贵公司及该岗位都有兴趣，相信自己能为贵公司的发展贡献个人能量，然后也提前了解过一些基本知识，感觉上手也较快，就来应聘了。
I am applying for this position because I am interested in your company and the role. I believe I can contribute my skills to your company's development. Additionally, I have gained some basic knowledge in advance, making me feel confident in quickly adapting to the role.

20.
Q：你觉得你在哪方面需要调整自己，以适应我们公司的需求？
A：我尽快了解贵公司的工作模式、运行体系、上级、同事以及业务对象的情况，我学得越多越快，我调整的就越快越有效。
I will quickly familiarize myself with your company's work processes, operational system, superiors, colleagues, and the business objects. The more I learn, the faster I adjust, and the quicker and more effectively I adapt.

21.
Q：如果聘用你，入职后你准备如何开展？你的工作？
A：一边快速向同事学习，一边快速领会并执行上级的安排。
I will rapidly learn from my colleagues while swiftly comprehending and executing the instructions from superiors.

22.
Q：你有什么具体的开展计划吗？
A：我只是刚入职，我没资格，也没有经验制定计划，先要执行好计划。
As a new employee, I do not think I am qualified or experienced enough to formulate plans. First and foremost, I need to execute existing plans effectively.

23.
Q：你对自己接下来几年的职业规划是什么？
A：先做好当前的工作，先成为公司的可靠员工，然后再考虑下一步。
Initially, my focus is on performing my current duties well, becoming a reliable employee for the company. Subsequently, I will consider the next steps.

24.
Q：没有更长远的计划吗？
A：有…但我一般不会在这种场合说。如果将来有幸和您在一起工作，我们以后当然可以交流。
Yes, they are... There are longer-term plans, but I typically refrain from discussing them under this situation. If I have the honor of working with you in the future, we can certainly discuss them further.

25.
Q：你认为哪些关键词可以概括你的特点？
A：两个：沟通，执行。当然还有更多，不过我觉得以我现在的身份，有这两个就可以了。
Two keywords: communication and execution. Certainly, there are more, but in my current capacity, these two should suffice.

26.
Q：周围人怎么评价你，你是如何看待这些评价？
A：我不太清楚周围人怎么评价我，但如果听到的话，我会记得他们的话，好的坏的都记得。但我不会去评价他们对我的评价。
I am not entirely aware of how others perceive me, but if I hear any evaluations, I remember them, both positive and negative. However, I refrain from forming judgments on these evaluations.

27.
Q：你做过什么让自己感到骄傲的事情？
A：有两次。一次是看到路上有男性在欺负女性，我去阻止了，另一次是看见有青年在欺负小孩，我也去阻止了。
(There are 3 instances. One was when I witnessed a man bullying a woman on the street, and I intervened. The other was when I saw a young person mistreating a child, and I took action to stop it.)
When I was a sophomore, my alma mater tried to demolish the dormitory. As one of the four representatives of more than 800 people in the building, we gathered public opinion through online voting in one day, negotiated face-to-face with the school's bureaucrats, and achieved a strategic victory. The school delayed demolition plans by two years until after everyone has graduated. As a result, everyone achieved a satisfactory result in a dignified manner, and the entire process was completely under control without any excessive conflicts.

28.
Q：有特别让你觉得遗憾的失败吗？
A：有，但我一般不在这种场合说。如果有机会将来成为同事，我们可以沟通，这个事。
Yes, it is. but I generally refrain from discussing it in this setting. If given the opportunity to work together, we can discuss it further.

29.
Q：你遇到过的最大的危机是什么？
A：有，但我一般也不在这种场合说。如果将来有机会成为同事，我们也可以沟通这个问题。
Yes, but I generally don't discuss the biggest crises in this setting. If we become colleagues in the future, we can have a more in-depth conversation.

30.
Q：你有什么兴趣爱好吗？
A：偶尔看书，写作，去博物馆，看展览。
Occasionally reading, writing, visiting museums, and attending exhibitions.

31.
Q：你认为自己最大的弱点是什么？
A：需要工作
The need to work.

32.
Q：你有什么想问我们的吗？
A：没有
No, I have not (yet, before I receive your offer). 

33.
Q：为什么没有？
A：现在不是一个我提问的场合，如果有机会得到offer，到时候可能会有一些请教的事。
It is not the appropriate time for me to pose questions. If I am fortunate enough to receive an offer, I may have inquiries at that juncture.
