# About

恭喜你旅行者，在如今的互联网找到这一方僻壤想必不太容易。

如你所见，这个个人网页定位类似一个公开的文集。主要部分是我和朋友们原创后授权发布的随笔：日记形式、和个人生活关系紧密的“司机行记”和关于纯粹空想主题的“游戏与怪谈”，以及由朋友们和我原创后授权发布的文集“沙滩文学-拾遗”。其他标注“搬运旧闻”的几个目录，则收录了一些政、经、学等领域的转载文章，如有侵权请联系本站管理员处理。

酒和故事都满上了，请随意。

Congratulations to you travelers! it must not be easy to find this secluded place on the Internet today.

As you can see, this personal page is positioned like a public collection. The main part is the essays originally created by me and my friends and then published with authorization: in diary form, "The Travels of Driver" which is closely related to my personal life, and "Games and Myths" about theoretical fantasy themes, as well as the "Anthology of Beach Literature" that were originally created by my friends and me published with authorization. Several other directories marked "Reprinted Old News" include some reprinted articles in the fields of politics-history, economics-finance, and academia. If there is any infringement, please contact the administrator of this site to deal with it.

The elixir and stories are already full here, please feel free to be.
